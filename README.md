## 🧪 Overview

Glaucoma is a chronic eye condition that leads to irreversible vision loss if undetected. This project aims to automate glaucoma detection from retinal images using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, improving early diagnosis and accessibility in resource-limited settings.

- ✅ Achieved **92% accuracy** in controlled testing using CNN-based classification
- 🌐 Deployed as a real-time web interface using **Streamlit**
- 👨‍⚕️ Tested by **100+ clinical users**
- 📈 Ongoing improvements using **data augmentation** and **transfer learning**
- 📊 Consistent **85%+ accuracy** on larger, more diverse datasets
-The analysis is based on the G1020 dataset, which contains annotated eye fundus images. The implementation is done in Jupyter Notebook, using models like Vision Transformer (ViT), ResNet-201, and MobileNetV2.
